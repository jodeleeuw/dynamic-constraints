jsPsych
=======

jsPsych is a javascript library for creating and running behavioral experiments in a web browser.
It consists of a set of plugins that can be easily combined to assemble different behvarioral experiments.


Documentation
-------------

We are actively documenting the library in our [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/jodeleeuw/jsPsych/wiki).
The wiki contains a [list of all of the available plugins](https://github.com/jodeleeuw/jsPsych/wiki/List-of-Plugins),
and working demos for each one are on the associated wiki page. If you want to get a sense of what jsPsych can do, 
trying some of the demos is a good place to start.
